                           ----------------------------------------


Files
---------------
Main.py- The main script. Translates all the *.jack files under the script args, and creates
                   vm files which contains the same program/ programs of each jack file.
JackAnalyzer.py- reads the output of the Tokenizer, compile the code and generates the vm cose lines.
JackTokenizer.py- same as last project. create xml code lines that contains labels for each token.
SymbolTable.py- This class responsible of mapping the variables of the scopes.
                The Class's scope and the current Method/Function/Constructor's scope.


implementation:
---------------
Run over the files, and for each file we
1. the main class parse its lines
2. the tokenizer creates xml lines with labels for the tokens
3. the Analyzer reads the xml lines and generates vm code accordinely
4. the main class writes those lines into a file with the same name of the file, with .vm, at the same directory.
