                           -----------------------------


Assembler.py - translates all the *.asm files under the script args, and creates
'binary' file - a file that contain only '0'/'1'



implementation:
---------------
The scricp runs over the files, and for each file 
1. parse its lines 
2. init its symbols dictionary 
3. run over the lines, collecting the labels and each line didnt contain A\C command, replaces with 'None'
4. create a list of 'binary' code segments, 16-bit wide from the lines which are not 'None'
5. printing those lines to a file with the same name, with .hack suffix
