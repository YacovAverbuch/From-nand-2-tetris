                           Project 8 - Virtual Machine (Control)
                           ----------------------------------------


VMtranslator.py- The main script. Translates all the *.vm files under the script args, and creates
                   asm file which contains the same program/ programs of each vm file.
Basic_Commands.py- Contains the get_* functions that returns the asm commends according the vm opperation commends.
                   (those from project 7, and labals, goto, commands)
Functions_Commands.py- Contains the get_* functions that returns the asm commends according the vm opperation commends.
                   (fonction's command; call, function, return)


implementation:
---------------
Run over the files, and for each file we
1. parse its lines
2. run over the lines, replaces empty and comment lines with 'None'
3. run over the lines,
    - translate the opperation (and the segment mamory  when the opperation is push/pop),
    - translate the labels
    - translate the function's action
4. create a list of asm code segments.
5. writing those lines into a file with the same name of the file or dir, with .asm. (if dir name- the file contains
  s the asm lines of all the vm files in that directory).
