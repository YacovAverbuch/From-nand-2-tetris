                           ----------------------------------------

Files
---------------

main.py - The main script. Translates all the *.jack files under the script args[1] location,
		 and creates .xml file from it
JackTokeniser.py - Contains the class with the functions to parse the file string into tokens
JackAnalyzer.py - Contains the class with the functions to compile the file tokens into their correct meanning


implementation:
---------------
Run over the files, and for each file we:
1. parse its text
2. run over the text and extract tokens. each token is a tuple in form of ('type', 'string_token', '/type')
3. run over the tokens end collect into a list,  with addind the inform tokens at beginning and end of every non-termunal role

After parsing all the files we output their token lists into coresponding files with the sufix .xml
