# From-Nand-2-Tetris
Implementation of the exersizes in course "from nand 2 tetris"
In the first half of the course (projects 1 to 5, not in this directory) I implemented with HDL (hardware description language) a fully working computer from NAND gates. The CPU is 16 bit architecture.
The project in this directory is responsible for translating JACK code (a Java-like language introduced in the course) all the way to the binary code which can be run on the computer above.
With the exception of Project 9 written in Jack language, the rest of the projects written in Python.
In project 6, I translate assembly code to binary.
In project 8, I translate VM code to assembly code.
In project 11, I translate from JACK language to VM code.
