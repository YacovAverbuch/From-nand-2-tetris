# From-nand-2-tetris
Implementation of the projects of the course "from nand 2 tetris"

In the first half of the course (projects 1 to 5, which is not in this directory) I implement with HDL (hardwere description language)
a fully, work computer from NAND gates. the CPU runs on 16 bit words.

The project in this directory in responsible to translate JACK code (a Java-like language dedicated to the course)
all the way to the binary code which can be run on the computer I build.

With the exception of Project 9 written in Jack language, the rest of the projects were written in Python.

In project 6 I translate assembly code to binary.
Project 8 is translation of VM code to assembly code.
In project 11, there is the translation from JACK language to the VM code.
